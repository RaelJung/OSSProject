#Question
1 What does this project do?
*This project runs a website that shows information about the characters in the Nintendo game Animal Crossing.
*Various users can be managed by the administrator, giving them permission to write and edit the post.
2 Why is this project useful?
*As people's interest in Animal Crossing is increasing, websites that exchange information are inevitable.
*I think that it can be usedd by many people because they can post and edit it themselves, and even post comments on other people's posts.
3 Where can I get more help, if I need it?
*Send me an email. (21900658@handong.edu)
